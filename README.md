## Development
This repo comes with a **Dockerfile**. It is based off of a Apache/PHP image and will install all needed PHP extensions and
as well as all dependencies via [composer](https://getcomposer.org/). It can be configured at build-time for either
**production** or **development** via [--build-arg](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables---build-arg).

| name     | default     |  options                 | description                            |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| ENV      | development | production / development | xDebug is not included in _production_ |


This repo contains a `docker-compose.yml` file that defines services for development as well as dependencies.

Use `run` for devlopment, it will mound the `src` directory (among others). It will install and attach a MySQL database as well.

```sh
docker compose up run
```

Use `test` to run all PHPUnit tests and linting. It will install and attach a MySQL database. This service is used in the CI/CD pipeline.

```sh
docker compose run test
```


## Debugging.
As stated previously, the `$ docker-compose up run` will install Xdebug and configure the _remote host_ to be the
host system. The remote port will be `9003`.

## Commandline
This system can be forced to brodcast event the same way as it broadcasts events when it creates or updates entries.

To get a list of all available commands, run:
```sh
docker compose run --rm run index console
```

To index all assemblies, for example, run
```sh
docker compose run --rm run index console:assembly
```


## Other useful commands

To make a dump of the database, run
```sh
docker exec CONTAINER /usr/bin/mysqldump -u root --password=example althingi > path/to/backup.sql
```

To import dump into the database
```sh
docker exec -i CONTAINER mysql -u root --password=example althingi < path/to/backup.sql
```
